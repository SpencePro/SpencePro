## Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a web developer interested in full-stack web development. I pivoted from political science to computer science, and am interested in building websites, web applications, and solving technology-related problems with a variety of tools, including TypeScript, React.js, NextJS, Python, and Django. 

#### What am I working on? 

At the moment I am continuing to strengthen my skills in web development and design with TypeScript and React.

I am also learning more about data structures and algorithms, as well as studying design patterns for web development. The lifelong learning aspect of programming is one of my favorite parts!
