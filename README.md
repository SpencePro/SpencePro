## Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a web developer interested in full-stack web development. I pivoted from political science to computer science, and am interested in building websites, web applications, and solving technology-related problems with a variety of tools, including Python, Django, TypeScript, and React.js. 

#### What am I working on? 

At the moment I am continuing to strengthen my skills in web development and design with TypeScript and React. My next project is a personal website; stay tuned for updates on that!

I am also learning more about data structures and algorithms, as well as studying design patterns for web development. I love the lifelong learning aspect of programming; it energizes me!
